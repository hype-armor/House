OpenEcho
=====
OpenEcho is an open source version of the Amazon Echo.

The purpose of either device is to perform basic tasks that are initiated through verbal communication with the device. The Amazon Echo uses NLP and I have been working on adding a basic implementation to OpenEcho. I'm just not there yet.

Download and build this awesome project. Import the dll it produces into OpenEcho.
